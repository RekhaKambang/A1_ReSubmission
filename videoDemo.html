					Video demonstration transcript. 
				</h3>
				<small>Or, least, Roughly similar enough. </small>
				<p> 
					Good morning, afternoon, or evening. This is a video demo of my resubmission for Assignment 1. My name is __ and I will be discussing and showcasing my work that I have done. Most of my work was already done before, so I am only here to touch up on areas that I was not able to finish or display due to a lack of my own understanding. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					The main theme of my website is meant to resemble a dossier that contains numerous paper documents. For my index or home page, it is supposed to be the front ‘cover’ of the dossier. Depicted by the large icons that organisations usually use, along with the red stamp that says the files inside are sensitive. Although if the visitor scrolls down, they will see it is not an actual formal, serious website with private information.It is just a portfolio website with no relation to any government bodies. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					A lot of report files I’ve seen had these flaps that would divide subjects or information accordingly, and I decided it would be a great way to show the ‘menu’ of my websites. It makes sense, since I will divide them accordingly to the labels. To show they are on a certain page, their current page would match the menu’s colour, as seen here. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					Next page is the portfolio. This page would have a more documentation approach as each project would have their own sections with description of what they do. But for this page, it is meant to be a sort of summary with links to each project’s own documentation. 
				</p>
				<p>	
					This page is the video demonstration. Since having ‘paper’ documentation is a bit old school, I thought having an old school video cassette player would be fitting for my website. I wanted to use a cassette player because I wanted it to be laying on a top-down view but realised it didn’t make too much sense time wise. I settled with an old TV with a player at the bottom. Below, is the fake table with the video transcript. I will most likely record my video demonstration with this placeholder movie, but the idea is the same. The movie is playing from the TV.
				</p>
				<p>	
					This is the contact page. Clipboards would fit the theme of documentations and record keeping, hence why I added them here. Visitors can email be directly from here, and they would be sent to their own email applications accordingly, with my email already in place for them. On the left is my ‘business card’ that contains my personal information that can be used to contact me through other means. It is the only element with a different colour, as I hoped that attention would go there first.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Last page is the site report. This behemoth of a page contains all my reports and modifications done with dates in them. I thought having one singular wordy text would have been boring, so I divided it into 2. It would also allow me to fit the formal report as well, and its lighter colour should grab the visitor’s attention more than the logs on the right.After the left side was read through first, their attention will go to the right and the visitor would be able to learn more about the website. It has a more informal tone, and I figured it wouldn’t make sense to put it with the formal report on the left.
