			<h1> Formal Report </h1>
			<p> This area is delicated to a formal report writing, regarding what I have learned 
				as I created this website from scratch.	
			</p>
			<p>

				Web development deceivingly looks easy. This is the conclusion I have arrived at as I have underestimated 
				the time, the workload that comes with web development. Not only that, this assignment has served as a harsh 
				reminder to me that I am not proficient with web development and my time management skills are abysmal. 
				<br>
				<br>
				The website or web pages I have produced now, leaves a lot to be desired. I am not proud. There were so 
				many features and ideas I wanted to implement but perhaps that is also the reason why I suffered so much, 
				trying to put so many things in at once.
				<br>
				<br>

				There were various ups and downs during my creation phase and it mostly started to go downhill as 
				the pressure mounted. I was fooled by the romantic idea of having so many different features at once
				 to impress the lecturer. Reality proved otherwise and I have barely much to show for it. 
				<br>
				<br>

				My attempts to do everything from scratch has backfired and I am now rushing for time that I cannot 
				recover anymore. However, it is not all gloom and doom. My experience has been quite the interesting 
				journey as experiencing the highs, when something worked, was extremely rewarding. Of course, when my
				 pages decided to break, it was bitter to experience. What I have learned as well is that this is a skill 
				 of itself. 
				<br>
				<br>

				Being able to pace oneself and delegating focus properly were skills I didn’t know was needed for 
				web development too. I was so easily overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work I had to do at once, 
				it was a terrible experience that I am determined to make sure that it doesn’t happen again. I will 
				be holding myself more accountable for the next assignment. This is not the end, I will pull my sleeves 
				up once more!

				<h3> Logs with dates </h3>
			<p> 
			This is a written report/log hybrid for the module, web development CSY1063 assignment 1. 
			In this report, I will go through the design and thought process of making this 
			website come to life. While in development, I will include logs and include 
			milestones that I have set for myself during the planning phase.

			<h2> 20 June 2024 </h2>
			<h4> Brainstorming phase </h4>
			<p> 
			Initially, I had plans to first think of the theme and then try to build 
			my website around it after deciding my website was going to be a personal 
			blog/portfolio site. The first few themes were themes of duality, 
			celestial bodies, endless sky, game styled shopkeeper and a vagabond with a 
			carriage. Since I have an artistic background, I made a lot of pretty drawings 
			here and there. I slowly realised that my ideas would be way too cluttered as 
			it demanded heavy attention everywhere, which may be exhausting for the visitor.
			Not only that, translating my ideas into mobile would lose its meaning. 
			<br>
			<br>
			So I cut down the complexity and decided that sticking to a much more simple 
			theme would be better. I decided that my website would have a dossier or an 
			archive file sort of theme. An old detective TV show vibe, if I am really 
			stretching. Basically, I wanted a top down view of record files being spread 
			open. For mobile users, they will have the same thing but will have a bookmark
			ribbon to pull out the hidden menu for easier access. Visuals such as document,
			paper textures, old vHS player, actual business cards, paper clips and polaroid 
			pictures.
			<br>
			<br>
			A feature I wanted to add was something similar to light and dark modes, mainly 
			why I wanted a dual theme going on. Thankfully, I can apply this to my selected 
			theme. Light would be like sunlight, bright colours as its themes and the dark 
			mode would have the same content, only that it would have a night appearance 
			like an unlight room that only has sunset light coming through. 
			<br>
			<br>
			If I had extra time, I could even have a blacklight mode so that the visitor 
			can try to find secret content with their mouse. For mobile users, they will 
			spawn a torch light that they can drag around but they will have to find the 
			torch first to be able to use it.

				</div>
			<h3>Planning phase</h3>
			<p>
			Features I wanted to implement are:
			Every website page has a special nav bar that will respectively darken or be 
			on top to show the current viewed page. There is a day and night mode on every page.
			Additionally, for night mode, there is a blacklight mode that will ‘glow’ hidden 
			content. Mobile users will be able to spawn in a blacklight torch from the menu 
			bar and drag it around the site, similar to desktop users. Desktop users will 
			have their cursors as the blacklight torch. The changes will be gradual and not 
			instantaneous (like a timelapse) 
			<br>
			<br>
			Every polaroid photo can be ‘picked up’ and zoomed in. Hovering over a polaroid 
			photo will say, “View closer?” Mobile users will see a text that says to tap to view better.

			<h2> 1 July 2024 </h2>
			<p> 
				Trying to write for this site has been an interesting and fulfiling expereince. 
				After being so used to seeing the front of a site, looking at the skeleton and 
				trying to construct it by myself has opened my eyes to the tediious nautre
				of web development. This probably applies to many other learning curves, to be fair.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have been struggling on how to start this project/site as it feels so daunting. 
				Espically after the fact that I have little experience to HTML. Never made my own 
				site by scratch. Where do I start? The grid? The template? Do I add the properties 
				inside the html?
				<br>
				<br>
				Thankfully, when I forced myself to sit down and start with the basics, everything
				sort of started to fall in place. Before starting with grids, I figured that just 
				placing the bones down would make more sense. So I started with putting down The
				elements I want present on a site and worked my way from there.
				<br>
				<br>
				Things like, Navigation bar, fake icon that I made, setting up the image sources. 
				To aid with other things like tool tip and hover, I used the internet to make
				sure I knew what was going on.
			</p>

			alt="Desktop screenshot of logo maker" width= "100%" class="evidence">
			<p>
			Here's my silly icon I grabbed from an logo maker site.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			So looking at this file through the web browser is making me cringe. I found a way
			to make the text more readable, by brute forcing it with double break tags.
			I will have to look up for a more elegant solution. For the text, I was planing to
			leave it as it is. Because I want the text to resize according to the viewer's
			browser. So I was planning to use CSS by placing id tags on it.
			<br>
			<br>
			For my images. Since I don't want to clutter my files too much, I have been using 
			Google drive to host the images. They all should be displaying correctly because
			I grabbed it directly from inspect element and I set the permissions to public. 
			Please reach out if that is not the case.
			<br>
			<br>
			That is all for my report for this day. It is surprising I managed to make so much
			and these have all been rambles of text.

			<h2> 4 July 2024</h2>
			<p>
			Currently I am trying to write up the basic building block for a caurosel 
			like gallery for my project html. I want it to be easily viewed in one 
			glance rather than it being all scrolled down into oblivion.
			<br>
			<br>
			 One method I found had something to do with layering a 'wrapper' around
			 multiple images. Turns out one usually used Javascript for it and I am a little
			 worried that it would be too much to do. I will attempt to do a Javascript-free
			 version and test it next to one made and powered with JavaScript.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 I refered to these websites for guidance: 
			 https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-css-only-carousel/ 
			 https://codepen.io/trungvose/pen/EydyoL
			 https://wpdean.com/css-carousels/  so many cool ideas!!
			<br> 
			<br> 
			 I figure the images might slow the website's loading
			 speed so I am wondering if there is a way to compress images into preview
			 first. I came across interesting articles for it.
			 
			 https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/#choose-the-right-file-format
			<br>
			<br>
			I managed to make a polaroid border in css but now there's a bit of floating
			issues that I will have to correct. 
			
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7731310/text-in-border-css-html
			Interesting stuff
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I just found out I was supposed to be using the paragraph tag in this manner
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I am struggling to wrangle the grid to function as it is breaking
			everything I am trying to do. I am also learning that having a todo 
			list is probably more ideal because I am all over the place. 
			It is starting to disorient me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Apparently headers are meant to hold the nav bar, I have corrected it as
			such.

				5 July 2024 
			</h2>
			<p>
				I believe I should re-think what I am doing and properly outline what I 
				want per website page. Everything feels way too cluttered out and the fact 
				that the deadline looms closer, I have to pick up the pace. Although, thankfully,
				I am freed from my other modules so I can finally commit my complete energy to 
				completing my ambitious project.
				<br><br>
				This is the outline that I have decided.
				<br><br>
				<h4>Supporting elements: </h4>
				navigation <br>
				document paper<br>
				sound<br>
				popup? <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Index</h4>
				transform <br>
				fonts  <br>
				image background maybe paper texture? <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Portfolio </h4>
				dossier_gallery <br>
				dossier file <br>
				file <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Vid_demo </h4>
				media player<br>
				video player Visual<br>
				dynamic background <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Contact </h4>
				<br>
				business card <br>
				email_document/clip board <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Site report </h4>
				report_document (formal report) <br>
				evidence pile <br>
				documentation  <br>
				<br><br>
				I had the option to use dialog tag but apparently it's a newer addition so the 
				issue of backwards compatibility came up and I decided to use nesting with z-index 
				to hopefully work.
