			<h1> Formal Report </h1>
			<p> This area is delicated to a formal report writing, regarding what I have learned 
				as I created this website from scratch. Currently, I am adding on for resubmission 
				as I have failed this assignment.	
			</p>
			<p> 
				As defined by the brief, I will discuss, reflective experience of the module, explain and 
				explore the design decisions,include validation reports of every file created along with 
				screenshots and the URL to video demonstration report. Additionally, I will add any code that is not mine
				as screen shots and links to where I got the source code. 
				
			</p>

				<h3>Reflection of module expereince</h3>
					<p>
						My experience with the module has not too easy because I was unfamilair with css and how HTML functioned.
						It did not help that the help provided, in terms of lessons and slides provided was not sufficient enough
						for me to understand what was going on. I had to refer to the internet mutliple times and read through
						documentations to understand what was going on. Although, I am guessing this is how things work, asking 
						for help through the internet and seeing what works and what doesn't. Makes sense, as I have little to 
						no experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						While my module lecturer attempted to go through the assignment bit by bit, it was just not enough. 
						It was limited and made me underestimate
					</p>
				<h3>Design decisions</h3>
					<p>
						The main theme I wanted my website to have was the feeling of report folders. Documents and papers
						all over. While papers are usually bright white, I did not want to strain viewer's eyes. Hence, why
						the main colours for the website is offwhite, leaning towards warmer tones. I will sparingly use
						other colours so that visitor's eyes will be drawn to that element first.
					</p>
				<h3>Validation reports</h3>
					<p>
						Here are the validation screenshots for:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>CSS</li>
						<li>index HTML page</li>
						<li>project HTML page</li>
						<li>videoDemo HTML page</li>
						<li>contact HTML page</li>
						<li>siteReport HTML page</li>
					</ol>

				<h2> Logs with dates </h2>
			<p> 
			This is a written report/log hybrid for the module, web development CSY1063 assignment 1. 
			In this report, I will go through the design and thought process of making this 
			website come to life. While in development, I will include logs and include 
			milestones that I have set for myself during the planning phase. Below this section will have each 
			updates done with dates
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="document_text"> 
			<h2> 20 June 2024 </h2>
			<h4> Brainstorming phase </h4>
			<p> 
			Initially, I had plans to first think of the theme and then try to build 
			my website around it after deciding my website was going to be a personal 
			blog/portfolio site. The first few themes were themes of duality, 
			celestial bodies, endless sky, game styled shopkeeper and a vagabond with a 
			carriage. Since I have an artistic background, I made a lot of pretty drawings 
			here and there. I slowly realised that my ideas would be way too cluttered as 
			it demanded heavy attention everywhere, which may be exhausting for the visitor.
			Not only that, translating my ideas into mobile would lose its meaning. 
			</p>
			<p>
			So I cut down the complexity and decided that sticking to a much more simple 
			theme would be better. I decided that my website would have a dossier or an 
			archive file sort of theme. An old detective TV show vibe, if I am really 
			stretching. Basically, I wanted a top down view of record files being spread 
			open. For mobile users, they will have the same thing but will have a bookmark
			ribbon to pull out the hidden menu for easier access. Visuals such as document,
			paper textures, old vHS player, actual business cards, paper clips and polaroid 
			pictures.
			</p>
			<p>
			A feature I wanted to add was something similar to light and dark modes, mainly 
			why I wanted a dual theme going on. Thankfully, I can apply this to my selected 
			theme. Light would be like sunlight, bright colours as its themes and the dark 
			mode would have the same content, only that it would have a night appearance 
			like an unlight room that only has sunset light coming through. 
			</p>
			<p>
			If I had extra time, I could even have a blacklight mode so that the visitor 
			can try to find secret content with their mouse. For mobile users, they will 
			spawn a torch light that they can drag around but they will have to find the 
			torch first to be able to use it. 
			</p>

				alt="brainstorming on paper, page 2"  class="polaroid closeUp" style="width:65%;">
			
				</div>
			<h3>Planning phase</h3>
			<p>
			Features I wanted to implement are:
			Every website page has a special nav bar that will respectively darken or be 
			on top to show the current viewed page. There is a day and night mode on every page.
			Additionally, for night mode, there is a blacklight mode that will ‘glow’ hidden 
			content. Mobile users will be able to spawn in a blacklight torch from the menu 
			bar and drag it around the site, similar to desktop users. Desktop users will 
			have their cursors as the blacklight torch. The changes will be gradual and not 
			instantaneous (like a timelapse) 
			</p>
			<p>
			Every polaroid photo can be "picked up" and zoomed in. Hovering over a polaroid 
			photo will say, “View closer?” Mobile users will see a text that says to tap to view better.

			<h2> 1 July 2024 </h2>
			<p> 
				Trying to write for this site has been an interesting and fulfiling expereince. 
				After being so used to seeing the front of a site, looking at the skeleton and 
				trying to construct it by myself has opened my eyes to the tediious nautre
				of web development. This probably applies to many other learning curves, to be fair.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have been struggling on how to start this project/site as it feels so daunting. 
				Espically after the fact that I have little experience to HTML. Never made my own 
				site by scratch. Where do I start? The grid? The template? Do I add the properties 
				inside the html?
			</p>
			<p>
				Thankfully, when I forced myself to sit down and start with the basics, everything
				sort of started to fall in place. Before starting with grids, I figured that just 
				placing the bones down would make more sense. So I started with putting down The
				elements I want present on a site and worked my way from there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Things like, Navigation bar, fake icon that I made, setting up the image sources. 
				To aid with other things like tool tip and hover, I used the internet to make
				sure I knew what was going on.
			</p>
			
			<img src="images/iconMade_Proof.png" 
			alt="Desktop screenshot of logo maker"  class="evidence" style="width:90%;" > <!-- width= "100%" -->
			<p>
			Here's my silly icon I grabbed from an logo maker site.
			</p>
			<p>
			So looking at this file through the web browser is making me cringe. I found a way
			to make the text more readable, by brute forcing it with double break tags.
			I will have to look up for a more elegant solution. For the text, I was planing to
			leave it as it is. Because I want the text to resize according to the viewer's
			browser. So I was planning to use CSS by placing id tags on it.
			</p>
			<p>
			For my images. Since I don't want to clutter my files too much, I have been using 
			Google drive to host the images. They all should be displaying correctly because
			I grabbed it directly from inspect element and I set the permissions to public. 
			Please reach out if that is not the case.
			</p>
			<p>
			That is all for my report for this day. It is surprising I managed to make so much
			and these have all been rambles of text.

			<h2> 4 July 2024</h2>
			<p>
			Currently I am trying to write up the basic building block for a caurosel 
			like gallery for my project html. I want it to be easily viewed in one 
			glance rather than it being all scrolled down into oblivion.
			<br>
			<br>
			 One method I found had something to do with layering a 'wrapper' around
			 multiple images. Turns out one usually used Javascript for it and I am a little
			 worried that it would be too much to do. I will attempt to do a Javascript-free
			 version and test it next to one made and powered with JavaScript.
			 <br>
			 <br>
			 I refered to these websites for guidance: 
			 https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-a-css-only-carousel/ 
			 https://codepen.io/trungvose/pen/EydyoL
			 https://wpdean.com/css-carousels/  so many cool ideas!!
			<br> 
			<br> 
			 I figure the images might slow the website's loading
			 speed so I am wondering if there is a way to compress images into preview
			 first. I came across interesting articles for it.
			 
			 https://kinsta.com/blog/optimize-images-for-web/#choose-the-right-file-format
			<br>
			<br>
			I managed to make a polaroid border in css but now there's a bit of floating
			issues that I will have to correct. 
			
			https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7731310/text-in-border-css-html
			Interesting stuff
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I just found out I was supposed to be using the paragraph tag in this manner
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I am struggling to wrangle the grid to function as it is breaking
			everything I am trying to do. I am also learning that having a todo 
			list is probably more ideal because I am all over the place. 
			It is starting to disorient me.
			</p>
			<p>
			Apparently headers are meant to hold the nav bar, I have corrected it as
			such.

				5 July 2024 
			</h2>
				<p>
				I believe I should re-think what I am doing and properly outline what I 
				want per website page. Everything feels way too cluttered out and the fact 
				that the deadline looms closer, I have to pick up the pace. Although, thankfully,
				I am freed from my other modules so I can finally commit my complete energy to 
				completing my ambitious project. </p>
				<br><br>
				<p>This is the outline that I have decided.</p>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Supporting elements:</h4>
				navigation <br>
				document paper<br>
				sound<br>
				popup? <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Index</h4>
				transform <br>
				fonts  <br>
				image background maybe paper texture? <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Portfolio </h4>
				dossier_gallery <br>
				dossier file <br>
				file <br>
				<br><br>
				<h4>Vid_demo </h4>
				media player<br>
				video player Visual<br>
				dynamic background <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Contact </h4>
				<br>
				business card <br>
				email_document/clip board <br>
				<br>
				<h4>Site report </h4>
				report_document (formal report) <br>
				evidence pile <br>
				documentation  <br>
				<br><br>
				I had the option to use dialog tag but apparently it's a newer addition so the 
				issue of backwards compatibility came up and I decided to use nesting with z-index 
				to hopefully work.
			</div>
		<div class="document_text">
			<h2>21 September 2024</h2>
			<p>
				I have corrected the pages to all be valid but will have to fix the sizes of most media. 
				Since validation does not allow values inside the tags, i will have to correct them from CSS. 
				The goals for this version will be to: 
			</p>
			<ul> 
				<li>Validate all pages</li> 
				<li>Correct and add more visuals to all pages</li>
				<li>Responsive design for each page, use of media query</li>
				<li>Implement hamburger icon</li>
				<li>Video demonstration with audio. Add video transcript at the page.</li>
				<li>Rewrite site report as requested.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				For this day, I have validated all pages as of now. Fixed most pages from it and 
				planned a bit on how the mobile version of the site should look like.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="document_text">
			<h2> 23 September 2024</h2>
			<p>
				Continued to fix the pages. Images were finally corrected for site report. Added 
				a 'looking closer' feature when mouse hovers over the picture of interest. Finally validated 
				CSS file after much trouble. Indivual transform properties were not recogised nor does only using
				'translate' by itself works. The work around for it was to use "transform: translateX(number here) 
				translateY(number here);" Which is valid AND works on the browsers as intended.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that the inital validation and corrected are completed, I will now proceed to attempt to wrangle the 
				media qureies. For now, I have added starter text into the site report and started the base set-up 
				for media queries. The colours are temporily, only meant to visual what query is active. I will have to 
				figure out how to make the hamburger menu button. Looking through the internet, it seems people make 
				clever use of the checkbox. If I were to implement this, I will have to rewrite the menu.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am also considering if I should adjust the div elements to have their own scroll-box sizes relative to 
				the website. Will text it out after I implement the hamburger menu.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="document_text">
			<h2>27 September 2024</h2>
			<p>
				A few websites I have looked through to understand how to have a responsive menu.
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/responsive-navigation-bar-using-html-and-css/" 
						class="linkedCorrection"> makeuseof.com </a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://medialoot.com/blog/how-to-create-a-responsive-navigation-menu-using-only-css/" 
						class="linkedCorrection"> medialoot.com </a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="https://css-tricks.com/responsive-menu-concepts/" class="linkedCorrection"> 
							css-tricks.com </a>
						
					</li>
					<li> 
						<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-responsive-navbar-menu-in-css/"
						class="linkedCorrection"> geeksforgeeks.org </a>
					</li>
				</ul>

			<p>
				It appears all of them uses checkboxes as the trigger for housing responsive menus. Since we aren't allowed
				to use javascript for this assignment, I will have to use this hack as well. The thrid website gives a lot
				of information that explains and covers a lot in great detail. A great read. To break down what I understand,
				it appears that input, check box is used along with label that can be the stand in button that responses 
				or switches 'states' as intended. For this case, I want to have the menu collaspe vertically instead when the 
				screen resolution is mobile size.
			</p>
			<p>
				The main structure would be to have a 'nav' element housing 'input', 'label' and link elements inside. The label 
				would be used to trigger the input tag. Then the elements will be controlled purely with CSS magic. 
				With some trial and error, I was able to produce these results on a seperate file entirely.
			</p>
			<div>
				<video controls>
					<source src="images/selfmade_hamburgeringMenu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				  </video> 
			</div>
			<p>
				I continued to struggle with trying to wangle with media query but have managed to understand it enough to make 
				the website behave as intended. I have noticed some interesting behaviour from the website and the emulated mobile 
				devices feature. They behave differently. Sometimes, the resizing of browser will be in opposite of the emulated 
				mobile device screens.
